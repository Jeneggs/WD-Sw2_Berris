            <h3>This website was made for a project in my IT0043 class, "Web Design with Client Side Scripting". It serves as a Resume that introduces myself through the art of creating websites. Through this project, I was able to exercise my CSS and HTML programming skills and can happily show the fruits of my labor through this website. <br> <br> <br> Although I found it hard when I started programming this, the project has given me the passion to keep pursuing this career. It has opened my eyes to the possibilities that I can create with the power of HTML and CSS. It has given me the opportunity to unlock my creativity when designing a website. <br><br><br> Overall, creating this website was a wonderful experience and I hope that the anyone going throug this website gets to appreciate (or not) my first attempt at a website. Thankyou!</h3>
